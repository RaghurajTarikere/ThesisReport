\chapter{Evaluation of the code generator}
\label{chap: code generator evaluation}
\section{Introduction}
By using model-driven engineering tools (MDE) tools for code generation, it is possible to generate software code automatically and achieve extremely high developer productivity rates of thousands of function points and millions of lines of code per person-month \cite{EvalCodeGen}. But, as we have seen in the previous chapters, the MDE approach consists of more than code generation tools; It defines the entire software-engineering approach that can impact the entire lifecycle from requirements gathering through sustainment \cite{CompBasedProcess, SAVOIR}.     

It is important to consider these tools and methods in the context of a particular system acquisition i.e., the MDE methods and tools need to be aligned with the system acquisition strategies, which would in turn improve system quality, reduce time to field, and reduce sustainment cost \cite{EvalCodeGen}. System acquisition strategies include: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Securing the necessary data rights and licensing for tools, models, generated code, run-time libraries, frameworks, and other supporting software
\item Reviewing and evaluating appropriate artifacts introduced by the MDE tools at the right time in the acquisition cycle
\item Approaches to manage program risks, include risk identification and mitigation 
\end{itemize}

If the methods and tools do not align with the system acquisition strategy, using them can result in increased risk and cost in development and sustainment. The acquirers in government or large commercial enterprises have the challenge of selecting contractors to develop their systems. The tools and processes selected by the contractors and developers have direct impact on the software quality concerns of the acquirer, who often has little influence on the selection of these tools and processes. The tool acquirer would then have to answer the following acquisition evaluation questions \cite{EvalCodeGen}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Do the engineering processes and associated development tools match the desired acquisition strategy?
\item Do the tools support the developer's software development methodology?
\item Are the code generation tools capable of integrating with other development and management tools to support measurement and monitoring of the development progress?
\item Will the selected development methodology with its associated tools be available and compatible for the expected lifecycle of the system? 
\end{itemize}

This chapter subjects the code generator developed as a part of the Master thesis to evaluation methods listed in \cite{EvalCodeGen} and provide necessary inputs for conducting the acquisition evaluation.

\section{Selection and evaluation methods of a MDE tool for code generation}
The step-by-step MDE tool selection process defined in \cite{EvalCodeGen} makes use of the PECA method \cite{PECAProcess} as shown in \cref{fig: PECA method}.  

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{PECAProcess.pdf}
	\caption{The PECA Process}
	\source{\cite{PECAProcess}}
	\label{fig: PECA method}
\end{figure}

As a part of the \texttt{Establish criteria} step in the PECA process, the acquirer must establish criteria with which he has to decide whether a particular tool for automatic code generation is suitable for a specific system acquisition. Such a criteria can be developed using risk taxonomy \cite{RiskTax} which ensures that all relevant acquisitions strategies are covered i.e., it provides a checklist to ensure all potential risks are considered \cite{EvalCodeGen}. The risk taxonomy has three main sections \cite{RiskTax}:

\begin{description}
\item [Product engineering] This covers activities that create a system that satisfies the specified requirements and customer expectations. Risks in this area generally arise from requirements that arise from requirements that are technically difficult to achieve, inadequate requirements and design analysis, or poor design and implementation quality 
\item [Development environment] This includes risks related to the development process and system, management methods, and work environment
\item [Program constraints] This cover risks that arise from factors external to the project 
\end{description}

To establish a criteria for a particular program/project, it is necessary for the program to first scan the risk taxonomy and identify those areas that apply for the project. Each risk creates one or more acquisition concerns , which may refine the program risk or indicate how certain tool features or capabilities might help mitigate the risk \cite{EvalCodeGen}.      

As part of the \texttt{Collect data} step in the PECA process, a vendor self-assessment questionnaire is prepared as in \cite{EvalCodeGen} which is given to the MDE tool vendors, to provide data needed to make the tool selection decision.

As a part of the \texttt{Analyze data} in the PECA rocess, it is then necessary to position these acquisition concerns in the specific program context and finally decide whether acquiring a particular tool is beneficial for the project.

In this Master thesis, a subset of evaluation criteria is chosen from Appendix A in \cref{EvalCodeGen}. The risk areas and the acquisition concerns which are meaningful in the scope of this Master thesis are chosen. Eg., the \cref{EvalCodeGen} discusses about potential risks in the Process Management area of the project and these are of no interest in this Master thesis and are not considered. Each of the acquisition concerns in Appendix A of \cref{EvalCodeGen} are then linked to the questions in the vendor self-assessment questionnaire listed in Appendix B of the \cref{EvalCodeGen}. For our chosen subset of potential areas and the acquisition concerns within this Master thesis, an attempt is made to answer the corresponding linked questions in the questionnaire.
